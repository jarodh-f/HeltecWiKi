<TabItem value="connect-to-server" label="Connect to LoRaWAN server" default>

## Preparation
1. A ESP32 + LoRa node that's configured and uploaded code, as described in the previous topic:: **[“ESP32 + LoRa” Node Preparation & Config Parameters](/docs/devices/open-source-devices/esp32-series/esp32-quick-start?esp32=lorawan)**
2. A LoRa server, We recommend the following three:
- [TTN/TTS](https://console.thethingsnetwork.org/)
- [ChirpStack](https://www.chirpstack.io/)
- [SnapEmu](https://platform.snapemu.com/)

3. A Gateway that matches the **LoRaWAN region** of the node, and already is connected to the lora server. If you are using Heltec Gateway, you can find out how to connect to the server in the [Heltec Gateway documentation](/docs/devices/lora-gateway/)

## Important to know

:::tip 
Regardless of which LoRaWAN NS, the parameters that need to be configured are similar. Ensuring that the relevant configurations of NS and Node are consistent is the key to ensuring successful LoRaWAN communication.
:::

**Device Type**

Generally, you will be asked to select a LoRa Gateway or LoRa Node.

**LoRaWAN Class**

`OTAA` or `ABP`, choose one of the while working, keep LoRa Node and NS select the same LoRaWAN Class.

*For development devices with source code, you may see something like this:*

![](img/connect_to_snapemu/03.png)



**Region**

LoRaWAN protocol agreement RF communication parameters. For technical details, please refer to [LoRaWAN™ 1.0.2 Regional Parameters](https://resource.heltec.cn/download/LoRaWANRegionalParametersv1.0.2_final_1944_1.pdf), also the [LoRaWAN Frequency Plans](/docs/devices/general-docs/lorawan-instructions/lorawan_frequency_plans) and [LoRaWAN Frequency Plans and Regulations by Country/Region](/docs/devices/general-docs/lorawan-instructions/lorawan_frequency_plans_by_country) can make sense to you.

The region setting of `LoRa Node`, `LoRa Gateway`, `LoRaWAN NS` should be strictly the same.

*For development devices with source code, you may see something like this:*

![](img/connect_to_snapemu/05.png)

**OTAA Parameter**

For OTAA LoRaWAN Class, mainly include`DevEUI`, `AppEUI` (Also called `JoinEUI`), `AppKey`, the LoRa Node and NS should strictly keep the same.

![](img/connect_to_snapemu/07.png)



:::note
If you select ABP, you do not need to set OTAA parameters.
:::

**ABP Parameter**

For ABP LoRaWAN Class, mainly include `NetworkSecuritykey`, `ApplicationSecuritykey`, `DeviceAddress`, the LoRa Node and NS should strictly keep the same.

*For development devices with source code, you may see something like this:*

![](img/connect_to_snapemu/09.png)

:::note 
If you select ABP, you do not need to set OTAA parameters.
