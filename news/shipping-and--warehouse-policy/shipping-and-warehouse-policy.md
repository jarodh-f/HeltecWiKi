# Warehouse Operations & Fulfillment
We operate a strategic network of warehouses to optimize shipping efficiency and delivery times for our customers worldwide.

## Warehouse Selection and Split Shipments

**Priority Fulfillment**
While you may select a preferred warehouse during checkout, we will always prioritize shipping your order from the nearest available warehouse to your location to minimize transit time.

**Split Shipments** If your order contains items sourced from different inventory locations (warehouses), the items will be shipped separately and will arrive in multiple packages with individual tracking numbers.

:::note
We utilize geographically located warehouses to offer faster shipping to key regions. If your specific location is not listed under a regional warehouse, your order will be fulfilled and shipped from our China Warehouse.
