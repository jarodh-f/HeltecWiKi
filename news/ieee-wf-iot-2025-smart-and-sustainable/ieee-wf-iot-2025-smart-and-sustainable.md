In Chengdu, November 2025 —The four-day 11th **IEEE World Forum on Internet of Things (IEEE WF-IoT 2025)**, held October 27–30 in Chengdu, SiChuan Province, concluded successfully. Under the theme **“Smart and Sustainable IoT,”** the forum brought together IoT experts, industry representatives and practitioners from around the world. As a Chengdu-headquartered provider of IoT devices and integrated solutions, Heltec participated actively in the forum and returned with important insights across three dimensions: trend capture, field validation and channel engagement.

### Global IoT trends

During the forum, many technical sessions, paper presentations and workshops highlighted that IoT is evolving beyond simple device connectivity toward system cooperation, large-scale scenario deployment and sustainable life cycle operations. For example, the Special Session **“Trustworthy, Reliable and Connected IoT”** included research addressing space-air-ground integrated networks and their implications for IoT reliability in challenging environments.

Another workshop, **“Energy Harvesting for Sustainable IoT,”** focused on energy-harvesting approaches — including solar power — as well as low-power node design and edge-network strategies for sustainable deployments. Taken together, these themes confirm that Heltec’s longstanding focus on LoRa/LoRaWAN nodes, mesh networking, solar-powered field nodes and complex-terrain deployment solutions aligns closely with current priorities in the field.

### Local manufacturing + global outlook: Heltec’s operational strengths

Since its founding in 2014, Heltec has built an integrated capability spanning R&D, manufacturing, testing and sales, with annual shipments on the order of 200,000 IoT units. During the forum, Heltec framed conversations around “China manufacturing + international certification + global delivery,” engaging system integrators from Europe and Southeast Asia on channel rollout, operational readiness and after-sales processes — demonstrating the company’s ability to translate local production capacity into globally deliverable IoT solutions.

### Key takeaways and strategic direction

Following the forum, Heltec advanced on multiple practical fronts:

• **Accelerated product & scenario validation:** On-site discussions and demonstrations validated Heltec’s solar-powered mesh node deployments for unmanned, remote areas (e.g., mountainous and arid regions). These solutions have already attracted interest from parties involved in European power-monitoring initiatives and North American forestry monitoring projects.

• **Channel and partnership development:** In industry sessions and networking exchanges, Heltec initiated preliminary talks with IoT system integrators across Europe, the Middle East and North America. The combined solution — mesh nodes + long-range LoRa networks + a visualized backend platform — drew significant attention for low-maintenance remote monitoring scenarios.

• **Refined strategy for 2025–2026:** Based on forum insights and operational strengths, Heltec has defined near-term priorities:

1. Strengthen repeatability of remote and complex-terrain communications node deployments (covering hardware, installation and O&M).
2. Deepen international market penetration, using Chengdu as the manufacturing hub while building B2B and B2C channels focused on Europe and North America.
3. Move up the value chain from selling devices to delivering full “scenario + operations + data service” solutions, enhancing overall IoT ecosystem capabilities.

### From insight to implementation

With IEEE WF-IoT 2025 concluded, Heltec is turning forum takeaways into action. Over the next 3–6 months the company plans to:

• Launch an on-site installation of solar-powered mesh nodes for a North American forestry monitoring project;
 • Initiate European channel development and engage local system integrators and IoT service providers to scale deployments;
 • Roll out an upgraded edge LoRa gateway with 5G backhaul support and further low-power optimizations for mesh nodes to better serve unmanned, complex-terrain scenarios.

As “smart” and “sustainable” become defining attributes of the IoT era, Heltec — rooted in Chengdu and oriented toward global execution — stands at a strategic inflection point and is prepared to seize new industry opportunities.
